If you check your computer's task tray you may see that the sync is still occurring. The amount of time it takes to sync varies based on the size of your Calibre library, but in most cases it will complete within 24-48 hours. If the problem persists log into your cloud storage with a web browser and check if there is a file called metadata.db. This metadata.db file is the file that Calibre Cloud is looking for to detect your Calibre Library."

We have made an effort to support some of the most frequently used services that offer free storage such as Dropbox, Google Drive, and Box. Developing new support for each service takes a considerable amount of time, so there needs to be many requests for a service before it will be added.",

If you find out it doesn't work, just email us and we can issue a refund, no questions asked. Another alternative is to check if the cloud service offers an app to sync with your local device and use the \"Local Files\" option available in Calibre Cloud Pro. Vote in the survey below to add your preferred cloud service we will consult the results of this survey whenever we consider adding support for a new storage service."
